As the sequencing depth grows, the resolution to investigate the 3D chromatin interactions goes from Megabase scale to kilobase or even hundred-base genomic scale. Furthermore, with the development of other “C”-related techniques, for instance, HiChIP, DNaseHiC, Capture Hi-C, etc., we will be able to investigate all kinds of genomic interactions at ultra-high resolution across the whole genome from the anchor regions that can be associated with clinically relevant loci such as regulatory elements, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from GWAS studies, chromatin domain boundaries or promoters. Analysis of 3D genome data will resolve many fundamental and long-standing questions involving the mechanism of gene regulation from distal non-coding regulatory variants, linking novel SNPs to putative disease-associated genes related to all sorts of disorders, the connection between chromatin domain structure variation and cancer or other genetic diseases.\nSuch technological advances in 3D genomics lead to great needs for new statistical models and computational tools to harness the embedding conformation information present in Hi-C data. To achieve decent interaction resolution, namely, how specific the region can be if we zoom in the genome to the largest extent, one study usually has billions of reads for each biological replicate. Hence, it poses a tough challenge on the model which should be theoretically sound and practically applicable and implementable within a short time. Realizing the demand in the field, I have developed a few fundamental methods, mHi-C, FreeHi-C, FreeHi-C SpikeIn, BandNorm and scVI-3D, with the corresponding software packages or pipelines to address many basic needs in dealing with Hi-C data.\nDue to the importance of sequencing depth in Hi-C analysis, I developed mHi-C (Zheng et al. 2019 eLife) to utilize multi-mapping reads that are discarded in Hi-C benchmark analysis pipeline. Multi-mapping reads are reads originated from repetitive regions of the genome hence they can be aligned to multiple positions. The ambiguity of multi-reads alignment renders them to be deleted wasting ~20% of the sequencing depth which can be translated into hundreds of millions of reads for one biological replicate. Through a hierarchical model that probabilistically allocates Hi-C multi-reads to their most likely genomic origins by utilizing specific characteristics of the paired-end reads of the Hi-C assay, the chromatin domain boundaries are refined and we can also detect novel promoter-enhancer interactions that involve disease-associated genes. Moreover, mHi-C, itself is programmed into a python pipeline with C acceleration, can process from raw data and output valid genomic interactions. Another urgent demand from both experimental labs and computational groups is a tool to fast simulate Hi-C contact matrices to work as biological replicates to improve the detection power or employed as a test of models under development. Also, the tool should be easy to use for researchers from all kinds of background. Therefore, I have developed FreeHiC (Zheng et al. 2020. Nature Methods) and FreeHi-C SpikeIn (Zheng et al. 2021. Methods) which empirically learns the interacting fragment behaviors, sequence characters, according to the Hi-C experimental protocol procedures. Sequently, with the user-controlled level of noise being inserted into the simulation process, a similar Hi-C interaction matrix is generated.\nRecently, single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation capture methodologies (scHi-C) enable profiling long-range genomic interactions. However, data from these technologies are prone to technical noise and biases that hinder downstream analysis. Collaborating with Keles Lab, we developed a normalization approach, BandNorm, and a deep generative modeling framework, scVI-3D, to account for scHi-C specific biases. In benchmarking experiments, BandNorm yields leading performances in a time and memory efficient manner for cell-type separation, identification of interacting loci, and recovery of cell-type relationships, while scVI-3D exhibits advantages for rare cell types and under high sparsity scenarios. Application of BandNorm coupled with gene-associating domain analysis reveals scRNA-seq validated sub-cell type identification.\nPublication Zheng Y+, Shen S+, Keleş S.

The increase in the copy number of protein molecules leads to a more robust detection of protein features compared to RNA, providing a deep definition of cell types. However, due to added discrepancies of antibodies, such as the different types or concentrations of IgG antibodies, the batch effects of the ADT component of CITE-seq can dominate over biological variations, especially for the across-study integration. We present ADTnorm as a normalization and integration method designed explicitly for the ADT counts of CITE-seq data. Benchmarking with existing scaling and normalization methods, ADTnorm achieves a fast and accurate matching of the negative and positive peaks of the ADT counts across samples, efficiently removing technical variations across batches. Further quantitative evaluations confirm that ADTnorm achieves the best cell-type separation while maintaining the minimal batch effect. Therefore, ADTnorm facilitates the scalable ADT count integration of massive public CITE-seq datasets with distinguished experimental designs, which are essential for creating a corpus of well-annotated single-cell data with deep and standardized annotations.","tags":["CITE-seq","Data Integration","Surface Protein","Batch Effect"],"title":"Robust Normalization and Integration of Single-cell Protein Expression across CITE-seq Datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shen S","Zheng Y++","Keleş S++"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"9b95ac216058e70a6b82764c8e122b30","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication/scgad/","publishdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scgad/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantitative tools are needed to leverage the unprecedented resolution of single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation (scHi-C) data and integrate it with other single-cell data modalities.

The role of repetitive DNA in the genome has remained speculative for decades however several recent studies have demonstrated that repetitive DNA can be potentially a vital drive for stabilizing genome contact. For instance, short tandem repeats, whose expansion is the direct reason for more than 25 inherited human disorders such as fragile X syndrome and Huntington, has proven to co-localize with chromatin domain boundaries (Sun et al. 2018. Cell).\nMy interest in the repetitive DNA began when I was participating in the ENCODE III project where I developed Permseq (Xin et al. 2015.

This review comprehensively and logically discussed the hierarchical genome architecture and summarized existing three-dimensional genome structure techniques: “C”-related, CHiC, Capture-HiC, DNase-HiC, ChIA-PET/HiChIP/PLAC-seq and CRISPR-based methods, with a gigantic table, reviewing the advantages/limits/relevant examples/computational pipeline. More importantly, it is such a resourceful paper that summarized how researchers associated all kinds of 3D techniques with disease-related SNPs. This gave us a clear view of what kind of 3D datasets publically available and to what extent have scientists come up with statistical models to link SNPs from non-coding regions with distal genes. I listed a few of them as follows:\n3D techniques, CHi-C/p-CHi-C/HiCap, provides high-resolution cis-interactome data at clinically relevant loci such as regulatory elements, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from GWASs, TAD boundaries or promoters. Important tools for connecting GWAS outcomes to target genes (many loci to all loci). (Namely, they can extract “promoter - other regions” interactions.) Pipeline to analyze them: CHiCAGO: robust detection of DNA looping interactions in Capture Hi-C data.\nCapture-Hi-C: A detailed catalogue of 22,000 promoter interactions was generated using promoter CHi-C for two blood cell types: the lymphoblast line GM12878 and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. 3D interaction data indicated that SNPs associated with autoimmune and other hematological disorders were significantly enriched at interacting distal regulatory sites of targeted promoters. Mapping long-range promoter contacts in human cells with high-resolution capture Hi-C.\nCHi-C was also applied to study autoimmune-disease associated SNPs in GM12878 B-cell and Jurkat T-cell lines. These findings demonstrated that different autoimmune-associated variants interact with common gene promoters. They also contradict the long-held assumption that disease-causing genes and their associated variants should be in close linkage disequilibrium (LD) to impart an effect. Capture Hi-C reveals novel candidate genes and complex long-range interactions with related autoimmune risk loci.\n3D techniques, ChIA-PET/HiChIP/PLAC-seq, study protein-specific chromatin interactome. Important in identifying chromatin architectural roles for proteins (many loci to all loci). (Namely, they study the “protein binding sites - other regions” interactions. Protein binding sites are similarly studied by ChIP-seq.) HiChIP identified genome-wide cohesin-mediated looping interactions: HiChIP: efficient and sensitive analysis of protein-directed genome architecture.\nPLAC-seq targets H3K4me3 histone marks to generate improved maps of promoter-enhancer interactions in mESCs: Mapping of long-range chromatin interactions by proximity ligation-assisted ChIP-seq.\nHi-C maps for cortical and germinal brain regions identified increased promoter-enhancer interactions compared with other tissues. The authors found novel human-gained enhancers showed significant overlap with lineage-specific lncRNAs and 108 significant schizophrenia-associated variants. (I feel it paper offers excellent data for a more advanced statistical model to link Hi-C with schizophrenia GWAS study!): Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.\nIntegrating study of 21 different cell and tissues types of Hi-C maps determines frequently interacting enhancer regions (FIRE) which usually associated with super-enhancers, typical enhancers etc (basically they are biologically functionally active regions). FIREs are tissue-specific, distinct disease-associated FIREs further strengthens the association: Alzheimer’s SNPs were found in brain-specific FIREs and SNPs for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were found in GM12878-specific super-FIREs. A Compendium of Chromatin Contact Maps Reveals Spatially Active Regions in the Human Genome.\nA MODEL leveraged existing Hi-C data to determine that variants at regulatory elements outside of LD blocks interacted with genes or their enhancers harboring linked SNPs to impact gene expression and disease risk: Modeling disease risk through analysis of physical interactions between genetic variants within chromatin regulatory circuitry.\nAnother study generates extensive catalogues of distal genomic regions that interact with promoters, or promoter-interacting regions (PIRs), in 17 primary hematopoietic cell types, linking 2500 novel SNPs to putative disease-associated genes related to blood and autoimmune disorders.

One mode of heme-regulated transcription involves amplifying the activity of GATA-1, a key determinant of erythrocyte differentiation. To discover biological consequences of the metal cofactor-transcription factor mechanism, we merged GATA-1/heme-regulated sectors of the proteome and transcriptome. This multi-omic analysis revealed a GATA-1/heme circuit involving hemoglobin subunits, ubiquitination components, and proteins not implicated in erythrocyte biology, including the zinc exporter Slc30a1. Though GATA-1 induced expression of Slc30a1 and the zinc importer Slc39a8, Slc39a8 dominantly increased intracellular zinc, which conferred erythroblast survival. Subsequently, a zinc transporter switch, involving decreased importer and sustained exporter expression, reduced intracellular zinc during terminal differentiation. Downregulating Slc30a1 increased intracellular zinc and, strikingly, accelerated differentiation. This analysis established a conserved paradigm in which a GATA-1/heme circuit controls trace metal transport machinery and trace metal levels as a mechanism governing cellular differentiation.","tags":[],"title":"GATA/Heme Multi-omics Reveals a Trace Metal-Dependent Cellular Differentiation Mechanism.","type":"publication_old"},{"authors":["Soukup AA","Zheng Y","Mehta C","Liu P","Hofmann I","Zhou Y","Zhang J","Choi K","Johnson KD","Keles S","Bresnick EH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536537600,"objectID":"b663c59f0a8f0e7b881138b44914c518","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication_old/ets/","publishdate":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_old/ets/","section":"publication_old","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Single-Nucleotide Human Disease Mutation Inactivates a Blood-Regenerative Enhancer.","type":"publication_old"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I’ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 …\nTip 2 …\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"e9cf4846d431ca1a3f0eaf112a488b41","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/software/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/example/","section":"software","summary":"In this tutorial, I’ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 …\nTip 2 …","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ha wa you\nTip4 …\nTip 5 …\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"40f38fa395f84a36feda22aa6eebef3b","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/software/example2/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/example2/","section":"software","summary":"ha wa you\nTip4 …\nTip 5 …","tags":null,"title":"Example2","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Duy Nguyen","Ye Zheng(co-first author)","Sündüz Keleş"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535846400,"objectID":"587fcfe9dd5f42df731932861b36d3f0","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication_old/treehic/","publishdate":"2018-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_old/treehic/","section":"publication_old","summary":"Hi-C sequencing technology provides key insights into the 3D structures of the human genome. Although peak detection from Hi-C experiments is a well-studied problem, quantitative comparison of Hi-C across different cellular conditions largely depends on methods borrowed from RNA-seq data analysis. Such comparisons have critical shortcomings involving testing a large collection of hypotheses in large-scale Hi-C studies. As a result, these existing strategies for detecting differential interactions fail to control the rate of false discovery (FDR) for reported findings in many simulations and experimental Hi-C studies, hindering their comparative analysis. To address these issues, we present TreeHiC, the first hierarchical multiple testing procedure for quantitative comparison applied to Hi-C data. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential interactions while assuring control of the FDR in complex large-scale Hi-C studies under a wide range of settings. It also is considerably more powerful than existing methods, especially in sparse testing problems where number of hypotheses could be millions with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, while the current version of TreeHiC implements methodology pertaining to Hi-C differential analysis, it is easily extendable for other similar data such as ChIA-PET and HiChIP.","tags":[],"title":"TreeHiC: Hierarchical Testing for Differential Chromatin Interactions.","type":"publication_old"},{"authors":["Ye Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"All the contents in this note are summarized from two Cython tutorials:\nCython - A guide for Python programmers.\nLearning Cython Programming second edition.\nCompile Compile by hand 1.From file.pyx to file.c (c file)\ncython file.pyx Type $cython to check all the options available for cython such as --cplus(instead of generating file.c, file.cpp is generated) --embed(embed the python interpreter) -2 -3 (compile based on python 2 or python 3 syntax and code semantic), etc.\n2.From file.c to file.o (object file)\ngcc -g -O2 -fpic `python-config --cflags` -c file.c -o file.o 3.From file.o to file.so (dynamic library)\ngcc -shared -o file.so file.o `python-config --libs` or LDFLAGS=$(python-config --ldflags) gcc file.o -o file.so -shared ${LDFLAGS} pyximport module (very convenient! import .pyx just like importing .py module) Get the file.pyx ready and in python or ipython:\nimport pyximport pyximport.install() import file file.function(para) Calling C functions from Python AddFunction.c #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;

Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50–100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","tags":["Protein-DNA","Repetitive Region","ChIP-seq"],"title":"Perm-seq: mapping protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication and highly repetitive regions of genomes with prior-enhanced read mapping.","type":"publication_old"},{"authors":["Ye Zheng","Stephane Aris-Brosou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1378944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1378944000,"objectID":"4cb029291da6ed67718821d7082f8b68","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication_old/abc/","publishdate":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_old/abc/","section":"publication_old","summary":"Studies on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) replacing the intractable likelihood function in evaluation of the posterior distribution have been developed for several years. However, their field of application has to date essentially been limited to inference in population genetics. Here, we propose to extend this approach to estimating the structure of transmission networks of viruses in human populations. In particular, we are interested in estimating the transmission parameters under four very general network structures: random, Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and an extension that incorporates aging. Estimation was evaluated under three approaches, based on ABC, ABC-Markov chain Monte Carlo (ABC-MCMC) and ABC-Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) samplers. We show that ABC-SMC samplers outperform both ABC and ABC-MCMC, achieving high accuracy and low variance in simulations.
