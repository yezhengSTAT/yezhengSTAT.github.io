We developed and validated mHi-C, a multi-read mapping strategy to probabilistically allocate Hi-C multi-reads. mHi-C exhibited superior performance over utilizing only uni-reads and heuristic approaches aimed at rescuing multi-reads on benchmarks. Specifically, mHi-C increased the sequencing depth by an average of 20% resulting in higher reproducibility of contact matrices and detected interactions across biological replicates. The impact of the multi-reads on the detection of significant interactions is influenced marginally by the relative contribution of multi-reads to the sequencing depth compared to uni-reads, cis-to-trans ratio of contacts, and the broad data quality as reflected by the proportion of mappable reads of datasets. Computational experiments highlighted that in Hi-C studies with short read lengths, mHi-C rescued multi-reads can emulate the effect of longer reads. mHi-C also revealed biologically supported bona fide promoter-enhancer interactions and topologically associating domains involving repetitive genomic regions, thereby unlocking a previously masked portion of the genome for conformation capture studies.","tags":[],"title":"Generative Modeling of Multi-mapping Reads with mHi-C Advances Analysis of High Throughput Genome-wide Conformation Capture Studies.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nobuyuki Tanimura","Ruiqi Liao","Gary M.

One mode of heme-regulated transcription involves amplifying the activity of GATA-1, a key determinant of erythrocyte differentiation. To discover biological consequences of the metal cofactor-transcription factor mechanism, we merged GATA-1/heme-regulated sectors of the proteome and transcriptome. This multi-omic analysis revealed a GATA-1/heme circuit involving hemoglobin subunits, ubiquitination components, and proteins not implicated in erythrocyte biology, including the zinc exporter Slc30a1. Though GATA-1 induced expression of Slc30a1 and the zinc importer Slc39a8, Slc39a8 dominantly increased intracellular zinc, which conferred erythroblast survival. Subsequently, a zinc transporter switch, involving decreased importer and sustained exporter expression, reduced intracellular zinc during terminal differentiation. Downregulating Slc30a1 increased intracellular zinc and, strikingly, accelerated differentiation. This analysis established a conserved paradigm in which a GATA-1/heme circuit controls trace metal transport machinery and trace metal levels as a mechanism governing cellular differentiation.","tags":[],"title":"GATA/Heme Multi-omics Reveals a Trace Metal-Dependent Cellular Differentiation Mechanism.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soukup AA","Zheng Y","Mehta C","Liu P","Hofmann I","Zhou Y","Zhang J","Choi K","Johnson KD","Keles S","Bresnick EH"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536537600,"objectID":"7bd85ceafd7e21a316e1ac61ecbc8e8b","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication/ets/","publishdate":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ets/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Single-Nucleotide Human Disease Mutation Inactivates a Blood-Regenerative Enhancer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Duy Nguyen","Ye Zheng(co-first author)","S√ºnd√ºz Kele≈ü"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535846400,"objectID":"8c2859a8725e763d2033f744d37d9f37","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication/treehic/","publishdate":"2018-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/treehic/","section":"publication","summary":"Hi-C sequencing technology provides key insights into the 3D structures of the human genome. Although peak detection from Hi-C experiments is a well-studied problem, quantitative comparison of Hi-C across different cellular conditions largely depends on methods borrowed from RNA-seq data analysis. Such comparisons have critical shortcomings involving testing a large collection of hypotheses in large-scale Hi-C studies. As a result, these existing strategies for detecting differential interactions fail to control the rate of false discovery (FDR) for reported findings in many simulations and experimental Hi-C studies, hindering their comparative analysis. To address these issues, we present TreeHiC, the first hierarchical multiple testing procedure for quantitative comparison applied to Hi-C data. We demonstrate that this framework can detect differential interactions while assuring control of the FDR in complex large-scale Hi-C studies under a wide range of settings. It also is considerably more powerful than existing methods, especially in sparse testing problems where number of hypotheses could be millions with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, while the current version of TreeHiC implements methodology pertaining to Hi-C differential analysis, it is easily extendable for other similar data such as ChIA-PET and HiChIP.","tags":[],"title":"TreeHiC: Hierarchical Testing for Differential Chromatin Interactions.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Zheng","S√ºnd√ºz Kele≈ü"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"d630018d468e6a6f344eaaa1210d4b29","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication/freehic/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/freehic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"FreeHiC: Data-driven simulations for Hi-C experiment.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50‚Äì100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","tags":["Protein-DNA","Repetitive Region","ChIP-seq"],"title":"Perm-seq: mapping protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication and highly repetitive regions of genomes with prior-enhanced read mapping.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Zheng","Stephane Aris-Brosou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1378944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1378944000,"objectID":"1875722c9f02f733aeebf46e85e3994f","permalink":"https://yezhengSTAT.github.io/publication/abc/","publishdate":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abc/","section":"publication","summary":"Studies on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) replacing the intractable likelihood function in evaluation of the posterior distribution have been developed for several years. However, their field of application has to date essentially been limited to inference in population genetics. Here, we propose to extend this approach to estimating the structure of transmission networks of viruses in human populations. In particular, we are interested in estimating the transmission parameters under four very general network structures: random, Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and an extension that incorporates aging. Estimation was evaluated under three approaches, based on ABC, ABC-Markov chain Monte Carlo (ABC-MCMC) and ABC-Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) samplers. We show that ABC-SMC samplers outperform both ABC and ABC-MCMC, achieving high accuracy and low variance in simulations. This approach paves the way to estimating parameters of real transmission networks of transmissible diseases.","tags":[],"title":"Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithms for estimating network model parameters.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Zheng, Ph.D.","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
